## 🚀 Features

- Predicts house prices using a trained Machine Learning model
- Interactive Streamlit-based UI
- User-friendly inputs (bedrooms, bathrooms, area, etc.)
- Real-time price prediction
- Deployed as a live web app on Hugging Face Spaces

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model predicts house prices using the following features:
- Overall Quality
- Living Area (sqft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Number of Bathrooms
- Basement Area (sqft)

The trained model is saved as a `.pkl` file and used for prediction in the Streamlit app.
